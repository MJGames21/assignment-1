    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am currently employed at Tim Hortons. I am always on time and willing to stay late if <br>
        needed. I have several years of customer service experience which has helped me to <br>
        grow and learn many life skills and thrive in this environment. I provide fast and friendly <br>
        service. I use my organizational skills daily when I stock and organize shelves and <br>
        displays. I developed my conflict resolution and critical thinking skills when I spent time <br>
        volunteering at a daycare where I played and interact with children in the Infant room <br>
        and the playground. I use my communication skills when I assist other co-workers <br>
        when working in a team atmosphere and a an individual.</p>
